## About me...

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I am Shubham, an Aspiring android developer. I am currently pursuing 
B.Tech in CSE(Data Science) from [BCREC](https://bcrec.ac.in). I am a huge Linux nerd and currently using Fedora
with [Hyprland](https://www.github.com/shub39/dotfiles). I have made projects using 
python, [raspberrypi](https://www.github.com/shub39/fingerprint-attendance), and built a
simple discord [bot](https://www.github.com/shub39/scrapify).

I am learning C++ for competetive programming and kotlin for android development. This
site was made using kotlin via [kobweb](https://kobweb.varabyte.com).

Also I love the Gruvbox color scheme.
